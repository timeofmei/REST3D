## News

🚩 **2026.06**: Released the code.

**2026.05**: Released the arXiv paper and project page.


## 🛠️ Installation

Please follow [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for detailed installation instructions.

When using Isaac Gym in WSL2, add the WSL NVIDIA driver library path to the
`gym` environment so that Isaac Gym can initialize the CUDA PhysX pipeline:

```bash
conda activate gym
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
vim $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
```

Add the following line to `env_vars.sh`:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/lib/wsl/lib:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```

Then reactivate the environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
conda activate gym
```

## 🚀 Quick start
Follow the steps below to reconstruct a physically stable 3D scene from a single image and interactively inspect object stability in physics simulator.

> Remember to set your API key before running (`GEMINI_API_KEY` — see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)).

**Step 1. Infer 3D scene from a single image**


```bash
conda activate rest3d
bash 1_infer_scenecanon.sh. #Change `INPUT` to your image path (defaults to the demo image)
```
Outputs are saved to `output/<image_name>/stage2/scene_canon/`.

**Step 2. Stabilize the scene**

```bash
conda activate gym
bash 2_stable_scene.sh
```
Outputs are saved to `output/<image_name>/stage3/`:
- `global_scene/` — physically stable scene
- `global_scene_w_walls/` — (optional) additionally fits walls to the scene and adjusts wall-attached object positions accordingly

**🤗 Visualize and interact with the physically stable scene**

```bash
conda activate gym
bash 3_replay_in_simulator.sh
```
Follow the printed URL to open the scene in a browser and interactively inspect the physics simulation settling process.
